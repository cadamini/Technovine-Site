## Why is it important?

__Networking__ is a *crucial* part of any modern-day business- in Marketing, obviously. However, what many business owners tend to overlook is the importance of their __Data Networking__. Your __Networking Systems__, both __Back-End__ and __Front-End__, are *key components* to the smooth operation of day-to-day business on *all* levels.

This is why having top-quality, reliable __Network Support__ is necessary for every company, big or small. Without a network that is both reliable and efficient, a company simply cannot communicate effectively with its employees, customers, partners, and potential audiences.

__Network Support__ includes making sure all __Networking Hardware__, __Software__, and other related dependencies are both up to date and functioning properly.

### Network Monitoring

Monitoring the network for potential problems, and resolving any connectivity issues that may occur. Another important aspect of __Network Support__ is security. Businesses need to be able to ensure that their networks are protected against potential cyber threats like malware and ransomware.
